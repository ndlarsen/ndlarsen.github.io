## Preface
This post will show you how to generate a barebones page and preview it locally.

## Creating the page
Jekyll comes with the functionality to generate a skeleton for your site. Suppose your new site project would be called "bitsAndPieces", you would generate the skeleton like this:
```
jekyll new bitsAndPieces
```
This will generate a folder named *bitsAndPieces* with content similar to the following:
```
bitsAndPieces:
├── _posts
|   └── 2019-09-24-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown
├── 404.html
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
├── about.markdown
├── index.markdown
└── _config.yml 
```
For some reason my version of jekyll uses a full *\*.markdown* file extension rather than just a *\*.md* one which apparently **really** bugs me.

Now, the *_posts* directory is the place to put your posts and as you can see there's an autogenerated one already.
The Gemfiles handles project dependencies, don't worry about them for now.
The *about.html* is intended to contain whatever you think your about page should contain and the *index.markdown* is the entry page to your site.
The default theme will generate a list of your posts on the index page so you can leave it untouched if you wish.
The _config.yml is the configuration for the site and jekyll will use this while building.

## Run it
You can view the page locally navigating into the project folder and running
```
jekyll serve
```
This command builds the site and runs a local version accessible at `localhost:4000`. Go check it out.
