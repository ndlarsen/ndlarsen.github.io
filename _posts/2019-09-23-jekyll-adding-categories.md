## Preface
While the basic theme, *minima*, of a new standard Jekyll site generated by `jekyll new site-name` is both nice and frugal, it is a bit, well, basic.
One of the first things I thought it lacked was a page or list with the categories, or tags which in as far as Jekyll is concerned is pretty much the same. While many themes come with this functionality built-in, I thought it a welcome opportunity to get my hands dirty rather than just download a finished one and be none the wiser. Alternatively, you could use `jekyll-archives` but where is the fun in that?

## Adding categories
In order to add a post to a category, just add it to the post header and Jekyll will detect the categories when building the site.

```
More that one category can be added by either seperating them by spaces
```
categories: jekyll extending
```
or adding them as an array.
```
categories: [jekyll, extending]
```

## The categories page
With the categories sorted we still need an overview, the categories page. I've added a categories.html file the to project root folder. We need to run through all the posts and gather the categories from each.
